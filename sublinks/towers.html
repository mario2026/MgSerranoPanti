  <p id="text">Bloons TD 6 currently features a roster of 22 monkeys (2 new monkeys and 20 returning from previous BTD games) and 13 heroes to help pop bloons. These monkeys are split into four classes: Primary, Military, Magic, and Support. But for this guide we only need to focus on Primary for now.
<ul id="text">
  <li><p>Dart Monkey : The Dart Monkey is the most basic tower in the game, it’s the first monkey you unlock during the tutorial. Although being the cheapest out of them all, it doesnt disappoint. It pops balloons at moderate speed, throwing a dart every 0.95 seconds, dealing 1 damage and hitting up to 2 balloons per dart. It has a moderately low range of 32. Costing 170$ on easy mode and at maximum 240$ on Impoppable mode.</p></li>
  <li><p>Boomerang Monkey : As the name implies, it's a monkey equipped with a boomerang. It can pop 4 balloons per boomerang and throws them every 1.2s. Its base range is 40 and throws the boomerang from the right hand going counter clockwise. There’s also a feature called the Change Hands option to target priority that swaps hands and direction. This monkey also includes many upgrades including but not limited to, ricocheting glaives, cybernetic enhancements, and heavy boomerangs that can be thrown straight. Costing 275$ on Easy and up to 390$ on Impoppable Mode, although there is an upgrade called Cheap ‘Rangs that reduces the cost of these.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Bomb Shooter : This monkey while being the category of monkeys is in fact, not a monkey. As it is called bomb shooter it does an exceptionable job at shooting bombs. Bomb Shooters fire exploding bombs every 1.5s with a blast radius of 12. Bomb explosions pop up to 14 bloons each. Bomb Shooter can be upgraded to improve its explosive power, its respective paths granting massive bloon stunning explosions, fast firing MOAB-destroying missiles, and clusters of black bloon popping explosions. It costs 445$ on Easy and up to 630$ on Impoppable.</p></li>
<li><p>
  Tack Shooter : This monkey is monkey in spirit only, being in the same place as the bomb shooter. This machine (monkey) shoots 8 tacks per volley across 8 directions. The tower despite having short-range efficiency, is excellent in clearing out crowds of bloons when placed near corners or intersections. Tack Shooter has a short range of 23, second-lowest to Ice Monkey. However, its tacks can extend beyond this range a bit before despawning. Every 1.4s upon detecting a bloon within its range, the Tack Shooter shoots a volley of 8 tacks, one in each cardinal and ordinal direction. Each tack can pop a single bloon; multiple tacks can hit the same bloon at very close range. It costs 240$ on easy and up to 335$ on Impoppable.</p>
