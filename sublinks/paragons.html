<p id="text">"Paragons or 5-5-5 Towers are the final tier of upgrades that were introduced to Bloons TD 6 in Version 27.0. Paragons are meant to be a superpowered upgrade of a tower, borrowing some features from all three upgrade paths of a specific tower to deal enormous damage to all bloon types (including camo), with bonus damage to Extra damage versus Boss Bloons (unspecified damage) boss bloons, and more. As such, they are among the most powerful upgrades in Bloons TD 6.[1] Paragons are created by placing all three Tier 5 Upgrades of a desired tower and upgrading any of the Tier 5 towers. Doing so will merge all three tier-5 towers, along with all other towers of that type into the Paragon. The strength or "degree" of the Paragon ranges from 1-100 and is determined by the statistics of the merged/sacrificed towers. These statistics include the total cost, pop count, bonus income generation, upgrades, number of tier-5 monkeys, and power totems sacrificed as explained below. Paragons are also unaffected by most tower interactions, like buffs and discounts. In addition, only one paragon of a specific tower may exist at a time (including in co-op), but the sacrificial Tier 5 towers may be rebought after creating the Paragon."</p>
