<p id="text">Heroes are a special type of tower that were introduced with Bloons TD 6. Heroes are unique characters that have their own personality, voice lines, abilities and attacks. The major difference from regular towers is that only one Hero may be equipped and placed per player per game. In addition, Heroes do not have the conventional upgrade system. Rather, they have a single upgrade path, with individual tiers being split into smaller "levels" that level based on Hero XP (distinct from Tower and Rank XP), which is accumulated automatically as rounds progress. In co-op each player may have one Hero, so XP is split evenly among players.</p>
